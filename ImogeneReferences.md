  * Timeframe:	2010-2014
  * Funding:	ESA
  * Partners:	Avia-GIS (BE), ERGO (UK), MEDES (FR), EARS (NL), RIVM (NL), VITO (BE)

> The presence and spread of diseases transmissible by vectors (such as mosquitoes, ticks etc.) depends on diverse and interacting factors such as present distribution, climate, weather and wind patterns, proximity to water bodies, land use and vegetation.
> VECMAP aims at developing tools and associated services for automated mosquito mapping and forecasting, integrating earth observation with modelling, mapping and in-situ measurement techniques.
> In Vecmap, _**imogene**_ is used to generate the solution to collect mosquito related in situ data using mobile terminals.

# STIPP: Cross border Information System for risk prevention in the Pyrénées mountains #

  * Timeframe:	2010-2012
  * Funding:	FEDER (European Commission regional funds), co-funding by FNADT and Midi-Pyrénées region
  * Partners:	MEDES, Instituto Technológico de Aragón (ITA), Ayuntamiento de Jaca, Réseau Télémédecine Régional (RTR) de Midi-Pyrénées, SALUD 061, Ecole Nationale d'Ingénieurs de TARBES (ENIT), Escuela Universitaria Politécnica La Almunia (EUPLA), Météo France, Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMet)

> The project aims to contribute to improve risk prevention in the Pyrénées mountains thanks to the creation of an Information Centre for these risks.
> The proposed solution allows in particular the data collection from the field in real time thanks to mobile applications.
> _**imogene**_ is used to generate the solution to collect risk prevention related information during mountain activities through mobile terminals.

# DIABSAT: Prevention and management of the complications of diabetes #

  * Timeframe:	2010-2011
  * Funding:	Midi-Pyrénées region, CNES
  * Partners:	University Hospital of Toulouse, MEDES, Auvea, Fleuret SA, DIAMIP, ONSIL, IRIT

> ![http://imogene.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/references/diabsat.jpg](http://imogene.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/references/diabsat.jpg)

> DIABSAT aims to develop and to evaluate new services for health education of diabetic patients and telemedicine supporting tools for the prevention and management of the complications of diabetes. The project has 2 activities where _**imogene**_ is used.
> One activity is dedicated to the detection of the complications of diabetes through a mobile van equipped with specific medical equipment and telemedicine applications to get access to expertise of remote specialists. In this activity, _**imogene**_ was used to generate the telemedicine Information System (Desktop and Web applications that were customised to meet the specific needs of diabetes cases management).
> Another one aims to support the management of the complications of diabetes by supporting visiting nurses through a specific application on mobile phones, giving them access to the expertise of remote specialists. In this one, _**imogene**_ was used to generate the mobile application for visiting nurses and the Web application enabling remote specialists to provide expertise on the cases.

# SAFE-Georgia: Satellites for Epidemiology in Georgia #

  * Timeframe:	2008-2009
  * Funding:	ESA with co-funding from Georgian ministry of health, Global Funds and the National Centre for Tuberculosis in Georgia
  * Partners:	MEDES, GMV, Telemedecine Technologies SA

> http://imogene.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/references/nctbld.JPG

> The project aimed to set up an operational service for the surveillance and reporting of tuberculosis and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis cases in Georgia. The solution is now fully operational. The system is used on a daily basis and nationwide by the National Centre for Tuberculosis in Georgia.
> In this project, _**imogene**_ was used to generate a Web application that was customized to meet the specific needs of Tuberculosis cases management.

# SAFE: Satellites for Epidemiology #

  * Timeframe:	2006-2008
  * Funding:	ESA with co-funding of partners
  * Partners:	MEDES, ISCIII and InVS (epidemiological Institutes), the University of Verona (microbiology), GMV (GIS module), TTSA (Telemedecine Technologies SA, satellite communication services), Remifor (mobile solutions of high bandwidth satellite communications for disasters), FORTH (organizer of the demonstration in Crete) and CNES (Cost benefit analysis)

> ![http://imogene.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/references/safe.jpg](http://imogene.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/references/safe.jpg)

> This project enabled to specify the needs in terms of Information System for health early warning and the frame of the possible added value of satellite communications for epidemiology. The solutions were demonstrated in a post-disaster scenario demonstration in Crete.
> In this project, _**imogene**_ was used to generate the Information System for epidemiological data collection. At this period of time, Android was not available yet and _**imogene**_ was generating a mobile application based on [eRCP](http://www.eclipse.org/ercp/) for mobile data collection.
