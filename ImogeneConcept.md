# An application generator #

> _**imogene**_ is a solution to develop and deploy integrated Data Collection Information Systems for any type of activity.

> _**imogene**_ focuses on the core basis of such a system, the data collection. In that regards, _**imogene**_ provides a complete solution that enables to collect and consult data in a various set of situations, on the field of operations as well as from analysis centres.


> ## Principle of the Studio ##
> _**imogene**_ is a software development studio following the **MDA** (**Model Driven Architecture**) approach.


> The MDA approach aims to separate the design of an application from its architecture.

> The system functionalities are defined using a platform-independent model. Then, this model is automatically converted to one or more specific applications.

> This approach enables to **concentrate on the user's needs** and to **quickly develop and update applications** since the development effort consists in modeling the application functionalities, the technical aspects are then handled by automated generation tools.


> Based on a modeling/generation principle, the _**imogene**_ Studio provides graphical tools to model business entities and generation tools to generate a set of applications based on the defined business model. This set of applications will constitute the _**imogene**_ Information System.

> The modeling/generation phases will result in a set of applications that will constitute a Data Collection Information System


> ## The Modeling / Generation phases ##
> The _**imogene**_ Studio development concept is based on two phases : the modeling and the generation processes.

> The first phase consists in modeling the business entities of the Information System thanks to a graphical editor.

> Based on this model, the platform will enable, in the second phase, to generate all the components of the Information System.

> Thanks to this principle, _**imogene**_ enables to easily update an existing deployed information system. This process just requires to update the data model that contains the information about the form design and to regenerate and redeploy the applications.

> With this architecture, the _**imogene**_ Information Systems are complete, integrated and flexible.


# Architecture #
> To provide these functionalities, the _**imogene**_ IS includes a set of multi-platform, client/server applications that are generated by the _**imogene**_ studio:

  * **A Web application** : This application is accessible from any computer via a Web Browser connected to the Internet, without any installation.

  * **A Mobile application (Android)**: Running on mobile terminals (operating Android), this application enables to collect and consult data in mobility situations. It works in both connected and disconnected mode so that the service is available even if a communication mean is not available.

  * **A Desktop PC application** : Running on Windows, Linux and MacOS X, this application offers the possibility to collect and consult data from a standard PC, a Laptop or a Tablet PC in situations where an Internet connection is not always available, in time or in space (mobile situation). This application indeed works both in connected or disconnected mode.

  * **A Synchronization server** : This application enables to automatically synchronize the data between the applications running in disconnected mode (mobile and Desktop applications) and the Information System central database.

> Thanks to this set of applications, the **imogene** information system is accessible by the maximum number of persons and is accessible in a maximum set of situations.
