# Context #

> This roadmap lists the functionalities that the Medes team is interested in adding to _**imogene**_.
> But these developments depend on the needs that are identified in the projects in which the team is involved in, the _**imogene**_ platform being developed in the context of these projects.
> As a consequence it is difficult to plan when these developments will take place. Some of them are already started, others will wait until a project where they will be necessary is found.
> If you would be interested in participating in some of these developments, please contact [Medes-IMPS](mailto:imogene.medes@gmail.com).
