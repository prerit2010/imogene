# Who are the developers behind imogene #

> _**imogene**_ is being developed by the [MEDES-IMPS](http://www.medes.fr) team for 3 years. It was primarly built up to be an internal tool that would help the team to develop the information systems that they had to develop for their projects.
> These projects were dealing with telemedicine, epidemiology and disaster medicine but the platform has been designed from the beginning to manage any type of data.

> After some time, some organisations showed an interest in using _**imogene**_ so that they could be independant in the building of their own information systems.
> To answer this request, it was decided to release _**imogene**_ as an open source project. It has been officialy published as such in February 2011 under the LGPL license.

> _**imogene**_ is the definitive name of the solution.	It had different names in the past such as **epidefender** or **medany**.
