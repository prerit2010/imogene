# Welcome to imogene #

> _**imogene**_ is an Open Source **Rapid Application Development Studio** for Data Collection Information Systems.

> Through an [Android client](http://www.android.com/) and a synchronization server, _**imogene**_ offers the ability to quickly deploy a mobile information system. Thanks to its advanced features, _**imogene**_ particularly fits for **surveillance systems**, where data needs not only to be collected but also to be regularly updated.

> _**imogene**_ is specifically designed for **data managers** who do not have advanced development skills but who need to quickly generate modern and efficient information systems. Because all functionalities implementation are provided through the studio, _**imogene**_ users just need to focus on the data model creation to have their **applications automatically generated**.

> _**imogene**_ is basicaly a set of [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) plugin. It takes advantage of the code already developed in renowned existing open source projects like [Spring](http://www.springsource.org/), [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/), [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) or [Google Web tool Kit](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/).

> The generated Information Systems include the following functionalities:

> ### Data collection: ###
    * The data collection/consultation in mobile situations (create/search/update)
    * The ability to collect data in connected or disconnected mode
    * The data storage in a central relational database
    * The automatic data synchronization between the applications running in connected/disconnected mode and the central database
    * The collection/consultation/analysis of the data from anywhere via a Web interface.
    * The collection, transmission and storage of binary data (photo, sound, video, etc)
    * The use of bar code (including [QR code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code/))
    * The acquisition of GPS coordinates
> ### User Notification: ###
    * The ability to automatically send to users alerts or messages (SMS, Email or pop-up windows displayed in the web interface) when specific events occur in the system (alert a user when a given form is created, when x forms with a field having a given value are entered in the system, etc).
> ### User privilege management: ###
    * The ability to manage user privileges based on users and roles associations.
> ### Internationalization: ###
    * The ability to provide internationalized user interfaces.
> ### Interoperability: ###
    * The ability to communicate with existing Information Systems. This interoperability is based on web services that enable communication between applications.
> ### Remote update: ###
    * The IS applications are based on technologies and follow development standards that enable a remote update of the deployed applications.
